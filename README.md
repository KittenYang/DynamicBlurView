# DynamicBlurView
A UIView-Class dynamic blur view like UITabbar or UINavagationBar, it can blur the view behind it.

You'd better dont make the blurView have large frameï¼Œit'll cause block the main thread. I although try GCD,but it will cause the CPU overload even the frame is small.So, I strongly recommand you use this demo when your blurView is small. e.g. a naviagtion bar or a tabbar is absolutely no problem.

Besides,you can set the color:)
